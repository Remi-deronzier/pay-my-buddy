## Overview
This project is a fictitious but very secure banking application that allow customers to transfer money to manage their finances or pay their friends.

## Features
- New users can register using a unique identifier.
- Users can log in from their accounts in the database.
- After logging in, users can add people to their contact lists from their username (if the person already exists in the database).
- A user can contribute money to their account in our application.
- From the available balance, users can make payments to any other user registered on the application.
- At any time, users can transfer the money to their personal bank accounts.
- For each transaction, a percentage of 0.5% is taken to monetize the application (Setting up a periodic task that takes place every day at 00:15 to take the daily commissions related to transactions). A backoffice for administrators has been developed.

## Security layer
- Account activation only after validation of the user's email address (via a link sent to this email address).
- Two-factor authentication with [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US).
- SMS notification for each monetary exchange that represents a debit for a user.
- Possibility to change the password if you forget it via a link sent by email.
- Obligation to create a very secure password.
- Impossible to connect to 2 sessions at the same time.

### NB
Since I use a paid service to send SMS ([Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)) and I don't want to pay, when you register your phone during the sign up stage, it is normal that the verification of your phone number fails afterwards.
